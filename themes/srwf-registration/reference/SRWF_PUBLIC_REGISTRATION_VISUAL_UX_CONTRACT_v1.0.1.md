## 1. Purpose


This contract defines the visual and responsive rule authority for the SRWF Public Registration profile of Gravity Presentation Profiles.


It does not define data, validation logic, conditional logic, workflow, upload rules, search algorithms, crop behavior, or other host-owned behavior.


A rule is implementation-driving only when this contract gives it an exact canonical value/rule or a separately identified higher-authority basis. Approximate visual observations remain reference-only until explicitly resolved.


## 2. Authority order


Gravity Presentation Profiles Mother Architecture
> applicable mandatory accessibility requirements
> this Visual / UX Contract
> Canonical Visual Reference Gallery
> implementation
> runtime visual/accessibility validation


The Gallery illustrates this contract; it does not override it.


## 3. Ownership boundary


Gravity Forms
→ form lifecycle, validation, conditional logic, submission, native field semantics


GP Advanced Select
→ enhanced-select search, selection, keyboard, mobile, screen-reader lifecycle


GP File Upload Pro
→ upload, preview, crop/re-crop/zoom, upload validation lifecycle


PersianGravity
→ Persian/Iranian field behavior where applicable


Vazir
→ font delivery in the current SRWF environment


Gravity Presentation Profiles / SRWF Registration profile
→ visual composition, spacing, tokens, state appearance, responsive presentation


Host plugins create behavior/state; Gravity Presentation Profiles styles that state.


## 4. External baseline


This contract incorporates the constraints recorded in `SRWF_PUBLIC_FORM_EXTERNAL_UX_BASELINE_v1.0.0.md`.


General accessibility/host requirements are not re-invented from screenshots.


## 5. Owner-closed canonicalization bundle


The following five owner decisions are closed and canonical for v1.0.0:


canonicalization_correction_bundle:
  mobile_horizontal_padding:
    value: 16px
    status: OWNER_APPROVED


  help_text_placement:
    value: below_input
    status: OWNER_APPROVED
    note: deliberate deviation from current Gravity Forms accessibility recommendation; runtime semantics remain mandatory


  validation_message_placement:
    value: below_input
    status: OWNER_APPROVED
    note: deliberate deviation from current Gravity Forms accessibility recommendation; runtime semantics remain mandatory


  control_border:
    value: "#8690A1"
    status: OWNER_APPROVED


  desktop_outer_surface:
    value: white_card
    status: OWNER_APPROVED


The white-card decision is independently owner-authorized. Existing supporting values `page-bg: #F6F8FB`, `surface: #FFFFFF`, `radius-card: 16px`, and `desktop-content-max-width: 840px` remain separately canonical where listed in the token table below.


Historical `18px` mobile padding and direct-page-surface treatment are no longer canonical alternatives.


## 6. SRWF visual principles


`SRWF-VIS-001 — CONFIRMED`  
Use a calm, light, low-chrome visual language with a blue primary action and red/green semantic accents.


`SRWF-VIS-002 — CONFIRMED`  
Use a mobile-first single-column form with minimal card-in-card decoration.


`SRWF-VIS-003 — BOUNDED`  
Desktop two-column enhancement is permitted only for an exact pairing set admitted by this contract. The exact pairing set is currently `NOT_PROVEN`; therefore no implementation may infer pairings from screenshots or labels.


`SRWF-VIS-004 — CONFIRMED`  
Custom presentation must reveal/style authentic host state rather than create a shadow implementation of host behavior.


## 7. Deterministic implementation resolution states


This block is the deterministically inspectable resolution register inside the existing Visual/UX Contract. It is not a second visual SSOT.


implementation_resolution_states:
  form_title_font_size: NON_NORMATIVE_REFERENCE
  form_title_line_height: NON_NORMATIVE_REFERENCE
  helper_text_font_size: NON_NORMATIVE_REFERENCE
  field_error_font_size: NON_NORMATIVE_REFERENCE
  desktop_title_enhancement: NON_NORMATIVE_REFERENCE
  focus_ring_exact_geometry: NOT_PROVEN
  focus_ring_exact_alpha: NOT_PROVEN
  field_vertical_rhythm: NON_NORMATIVE_REFERENCE
  major_section_rhythm: NON_NORMATIVE_REFERENCE
  desktop_short_field_pairings: NOT_PROVEN
  desktop_shadow_exact_value: NOT_PROVEN


Interpretation:


- `NON_NORMATIVE_REFERENCE`: useful visual observation, but not an implementation value.
- `NOT_PROVEN`: no exact value/rule may be chosen without new evidence or owner authority.
- exact canonical values live in explicit canonical tables/rules in this document.


Reference-only observations retained for provenance/context, not for implementation:


form title size observed around 24px
form title line-height observed around 1.5
helper text observed around 13.5px
field error observed around 14px
desktop title enhancement observed around 26px
field rhythm observed around 24px
major-section rhythm observed around 32px
owner visual intent for desktop shadow: none or very subtle


No consumer may round, normalize, or guess these observations into production values.


## 8. Canonical design tokens


| Token | Canonical value | Status |
|---|---:|---|
| `page-bg` | `#F6F8FB` | confirmed |
| `surface` | `#FFFFFF` | confirmed |
| `text-primary` | `#172033` | confirmed |
| `text-secondary` | `#475467` | confirmed |
| `text-muted` | `#667085` | confirmed |
| `primary` | `#1D4ED8` | confirmed |
| `primary-pressed` | `#1E40AF` | confirmed |
| `error` | `#B42318` | confirmed |
| `success` | `#18794E` | confirmed |
| `divider` | `#E4E7EC` | confirmed as decorative divider |
| `control-border` | `#8690A1` | owner-approved |
| `radius-control` | `10px` | confirmed |
| `radius-upload` | `12px` | confirmed |
| `radius-card` | `16px` | confirmed |
| `control-min-height` | `52px` | confirmed |
| `primary-button-min-height` | `56px` | confirmed |
| `mobile-horizontal-padding` | `16px` | owner-approved |
| `desktop-content-max-width` | `840px` | confirmed |


Focus presentation has an exact canonical color basis (`primary: #1D4ED8`) but the ring geometry and alpha remain `NOT_PROVEN`; the earlier phrase “translucent ring” is visual intent only, not a CSS value.


### Placeholder rule


`#9CA3AF` from the mockups is not a canonical color for meaningful instructional text because its contrast on white is too low for normal text.


Placeholder text may remain visually subtle only when redundant/non-material. Required instructions must remain persistent outside placeholder-only presentation and must satisfy applicable text-contrast requirements.


## 9. Typography hierarchy


Exact canonical typography values currently supported by admitted evidence are:


section_heading:
  font_size: 18px
  font_weight: 700
field_label:
  font_size: 15px
  font_weight: 600
control_value:
  font_size: 16px
  font_weight: 400
primary_action:
  font_size: 16px
  font_weight: 700
font_family_target:
  value: Vazirmatn
  delivery_owner: Vazir


Form-title size/line-height, helper-text size, field-error size, and desktop-title enhancement are reference-only until resolved in Section 7. Their observed approximate values must not drive CSS.


## 10. RTL and directionality


The SRWF profile is Persian/RTL in composition. Use direction-safe/logical CSS where practical.


Values that are inherently numeric/Latin, such as phone or National ID entry, may render LTR while preserving correct labels, reading order, and host semantics.


## 11. Responsive contract


### 320px


This is a hard acceptance width.


At 320 CSS px:


- ordinary fields are one column;
- no ordinary form content requires horizontal scrolling;
- labels, controls, helper text, and field errors remain readable;
- any future admitted desktop field pairs must collapse;
- school/upload/photo states must fit available width;
- horizontal content padding is exactly `16px`.


### 360px


Primary mobile visual reference width.


### 390px / 430px


Use the same semantic mobile composition. A dedicated 430px approved reference is not required to define a different layout.


### Desktop


- outer surface is `white_card`;
- page background is canonical token `#F6F8FB`;
- form surface is canonical token `#FFFFFF`;
- form max width is canonical token `840px`;
- outer radius is canonical token `16px`;
- exact shadow CSS value is `NOT_PROVEN`;
- exact two-column short-field pairing set is `NOT_PROVEN`;
- school selector and file/photo upload states remain full width where needed.


Until the pairing set is admitted, implementation must fail closed to no inferred two-column pairing.


### Production breakpoint


exact_production_breakpoint: NOT_PROVEN


Do not copy a mockup/gallery media-query value merely because it appears in a prototype.


## 12. Form and section composition


- Keep the form visually continuous and restrained.
- Use section headings plus subtle dividers for grouping.
- Field and major-section rhythm observations remain `NON_NORMATIVE_REFERENCE` in Section 7 and must not be implemented as guessed exact spacing.
- Decorative dividers must not be the sole means of conveying grouping/meaning.
- Avoid unnecessary nested cards around ordinary fields.


## 13. Component contract matrix


| Component | Behavior owner | Gravity Presentation Profiles visual responsibility | Runtime-sensitive |
|---|---|---|---|
| Text/numeric input | Gravity Forms / PersianGravity where applicable | 52px min height, 10px radius, white fill, `#8690A1` border, SRWF focus/error language | actual host markup/semantics; exact focus ring geometry |
| National ID / phone | Host | same control family, clear persistent format instruction, LTR value where appropriate | validation behavior |
| Jalali date | PersianGravity / Gravity Forms | visually integrate real runtime control into SRWF control language | exact widget/picker UI not proven |
| Radio / choice | Gravity Forms | clear selected state with shape/text + color, not color only | fieldset/keyboard semantics |
| Native select | Gravity Forms | same visual family | browser/host behavior |
| School selector | GP Advanced Select | resting/open/results/no-results/selected/error appearance | actual GPAS DOM/config/search behavior |
| Other-school conditional field | Gravity Forms | same field family when host reveals it | trigger logic |
| Report-card upload | Gravity Forms / GPFUP if enabled | initial/uploading/uploaded/error/replace visual states | actual constraints/upload lifecycle |
| Student photo | GP File Upload Pro | upload/preview/crop/re-crop state styling | crop ratio/dimensions/config |
| Primary action | Gravity Forms | primary blue, 56px min height, responsive width | submit lifecycle |
| Validation summary | Gravity Forms | SRWF red semantic surface | focus/ARIA runtime |
| Field error | Gravity Forms | textual red error + border/icon where appropriate; below input | accessible association/runtime order; exact font size unresolved |
| Helper text | Gravity Forms | muted persistent text; below input | accessible association/runtime order; exact font size unresolved |
| Required indicator | Gravity Forms | visible red semantic styling | underlying required semantics |


## 14. Help/instruction presentation


Owner decision: `help_text_placement: below_input`.


This is canonical for the SRWF visual profile. Material format instructions must remain persistent and not placeholder-only; host semantic association must remain intact; runtime screen-reader/reading-order validation is mandatory because this differs from current Gravity Forms recommended placement.


## 15. Validation/error presentation


The host detects and exposes validation state. Gravity Presentation Profiles maps that state visually to:


textual field error below the affected input
+ red semantic border/state styling
+ additional non-color cue where needed
+ Gravity Forms validation summary
+ preservation of user-entered values


Owner decision: `validation_message_placement: below_input`.


This visual placement must not break programmatic error association or focus/reading behavior. The plugin must not implement its own validation engine.


## 16. Control border / contrast rule


Canonical resting border is `#8690A1`, replacing the earlier `#8993A4` candidate.


Final implementation must still verify actual contrast against the rendered adjacent background after Gravity Forms/theme composition. Runtime contrast remains `NOT_PROVEN` until executed.


## 17. Desktop outer surface


Owner-selected canonical surface type is `white_card`.


The supporting exact tokens are:


page_background: "#F6F8FB"
surface: "#FFFFFF"
max_width: 840px
outer_radius: 16px
shadow_exact_value: NOT_PROVEN


The non-normative visual intent is a distinct but quiet white form card, with no heavy dashboard-style panel. The exact shadow must not be guessed from “none or very subtle.”


## 18. School selector presentation


Allowed visual states include resting, focused/open, searching/results, no results, selected, selected-other, and error.


GP Advanced Select owns the actual search/filter/keyboard lifecycle. Do not contract lazy loading, a specific query threshold, infinite scrolling, or Populate Anything behavior unless the real field configuration proves it.


## 19. Upload and student-photo presentation


Allowed visual states may include initial, uploading, uploaded, preview, invalid file, remove/replace, and crop/re-crop where the host provides it.


GP File Upload Pro owns upload/crop/re-crop/zoom behavior. Exact crop ratio/dimensions remain runtime/configuration evidence, not mockup authority.


## 20. Accessibility design requirements


The profile must preserve at least these outcomes:


visible persistent labels
persistent material instructions
textual errors
error/selection not color-only
applicable 3:1 UI visual cues
applicable 4.5:1 normal meaningful text
visible keyboard focus
320px reflow
WCAG target-size outcome or valid exception
native host semantics and keyboard behavior


The contract supports accessibility; it does not itself prove WCAG conformance.


## 21. Host-owned behavior firewall


The following prototype behavior is not implementation authority:


school query/filter algorithms
lazy loading
infinite scroll
conditional logic
validation engine
Jalali calculations
file acceptance rules
crop engine
submission lifecycle
success transition logic


Interactive mockup scripts remain `MOCKUP_ONLY_SIMULATION` unless independently supported by the real host/runtime contract.


## 22. Runtime-sensitive items


actual_gravity_forms_markup: NOT_PROVEN
actual_persiangravity_date_widget: NOT_PROVEN
gpas_populate_anything_configuration: NOT_PROVEN
gpfup_crop_ratio_dimensions: NOT_PROVEN
keyboard_order: NOT_PROVEN
focus_management: NOT_PROVEN
aria_relations: NOT_PROVEN
screen_reader_output: NOT_PROVEN
exact_production_breakpoint: NOT_PROVEN
runtime_contrast_after_host_css: NOT_PROVEN


These are validation gaps, not open owner visual choices.


## 23. Non-goals


This contract does not authorize field/ID changes, business validation changes, conditional-logic changes, stored-value changes, Gravity Flow changes, upload constraint changes, Officer/Accountant UI, multiple visual themes, a visual editor, production JavaScript by default, PDF presentation, or production plugin implementation.


## 24. Visual acceptance


A future implementation is visually conformant only when all of the following are true:


exact canonical contract tokens/rules applied
+ unresolved items remain fail-closed rather than guessed
+ correct mobile/desktop composition
+ authentic host states styled rather than reimplemented
+ approved reference-gallery match where applicable
+ no higher-authority accessibility conflict
+ real browser/runtime validation completed


## 25. Change control


- Gallery references cannot override this contract.
- Screenshot-only differences do not silently change canonical tokens/rules.
- A design-rule change requires an explicit contract revision.
- A `NOT_PROVEN` or `NON_NORMATIVE_REFERENCE` item may become canonical only after exact authority/evidence is recorded in this contract.
- A runtime accessibility correction that materially changes the approved appearance must be recorded as a contract revision, not hidden in CSS.


## 26. Evidence map and closure state

## 27. Owner resolution addendum — 2026-09-18


The Owner explicitly confirmed that the following admitted visual-artifact fragments are implementation-driving destination requirements for SRWF Registration, not merely reference-only observations:


- `gender_binary_choice`: the Gender field uses two equal-width card-style choices in one row. Selected state must be communicated with shape/text plus primary-color treatment and a subtle primary-tinted surface; unselected state remains a neutral white card. Native Gravity Forms radio semantics, keyboard behavior, labels, and validation remain host-owned.
- `graduation_status_binary_choice`: the Graduation Status conditional field uses the same binary card-choice presentation when Gravity Forms reveals that authentic field/state. Conditional logic remains host-owned.
- `report_card_upload_initial`: the report-card upload initial state uses the approved compact dashed upload surface with file icon, title/instruction treatment, and subdued file-rule text. Gravity Forms / GP File Upload Pro continue to own upload rules and lifecycle.
- `student_photo_uploaded_state`: the student-photo uploaded state uses the approved composition with visible preview/status plus a replace-upload area and authentic re-crop/delete actions where GP File Upload Pro provides them. GTB/GPP may style those real host states but must not implement crop, delete, replace, upload, or preview behavior itself.
- `section_heading_iconography`: section-heading icon tiles shown in the admitted approved artifact are required for the sections where that artifact explicitly provides them. Implementation must follow the artifact mapping and must not infer new icon semantics from field labels.


Scope of this resolution:


- This resolves the earlier visual ambiguity for the explicitly named choice-card, upload/photo-state, and section-icon surfaces above.
- It does not authorize applying binary card styling to every radio field by inference.
- It does not authorize numeric Form/Field IDs as the durable semantic styling contract.
- A bounded semantic binding must identify these presentation roles without label-text inference.
- GP File Upload Pro behavior remains authoritative for upload/preview/crop/re-crop/delete state; this resolution authorizes visual matching of authentic states only.
- Exact crop ratio/dimensions remain runtime/configuration evidence.
- `exact_production_breakpoint`, `desktop_short_field_pairings`, `desktop_shadow_exact_value`, form-title exact size/line-height, helper/error exact sizes, field/section rhythm, and focus-ring exact geometry/alpha remain unresolved exactly as previously recorded.


This addendum is explicit Owner authority and supersedes any prior interpretation that these named visual fragments were non-normative only.
